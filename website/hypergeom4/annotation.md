Annotation results
========================================================

The annotation analysis simply annotates each SNP in a set for an overlap with the selected regulatory datasets. It also calculates the total number of overlaps for each SNP, which may serve as a crude estimate of SNP's functional impact. There are countless such databases and tools that do it better, such as [FunciSNP](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/FunciSNP.html), [GWAVA](https://www.sanger.ac.uk/sanger/StatGen_Gwava), [Annovar](http://www.openbioinformatics.org/annovar/), [RegulomeDB](http://www.regulomedb.org/), just to name a few, and it is advised to use them for annotation of SNPs.

The output of the annotation analysis are available on a corresponding tab on the results page. For each SNP set, a subtab is created.
