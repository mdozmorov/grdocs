========================================================

GenomeRunner depends on many modules and packages. They are installed using `setup.sh` script. Sudo privileges required. These installation instructions were tested on freshly installed Ubuntu Linux 13.10 (Saucy Salamander).

To install GenomeRunner locally, clone GenomeRunner's repository locally (`git` must be installed, `sudo apt-get install git`), and run `setup.sh`.


```r
> git clone https://github.com/mdozmorov/genome_runner.git
> ./setup.sh
```
