Modules
========================================================

GenomeRunner is installed as a `grsnp` package. There are three modules in the package:

1. `dbcreator` # A module for creating organism-specific database
2. `server` # main module
3. `optimizer` # A module to pre-calculate background overlaps with all genomic features


Before running GenomeRunner, the first step involves creating a database of genomic annotations using `dbcreator` module. Then, GenomeRunner can be run using the `server` module.
